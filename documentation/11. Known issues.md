## 1. Tool Factory Pattern Limitations

### Issue
The factory pattern used for tool initialization (`create_tool()`) has reliability issues compared to direct imports. Specifically:

- The factory relies on registry initialization that must complete before tool creation
- Dynamic import relies on strict naming conventions that may be inconsistent
- Error propagation is complex, making debugging difficult
- Mixed tool representation (functions vs. classes) creates integration inconsistencies

### Solution
Agent templates now use direct imports for tools instead of the factory pattern:

```python
# Old approach (problematic)
from aigen.tools.factory import create_tool
self.add_tool(create_tool("tavily_search"))

# New approach (reliable)
from aigen.tools.research import tavily_search_tool
self.add_tool(tavily_search_tool)
```

This direct import approach provides better compile-time verification, clearer error messages, and more reliable tool initialization.
