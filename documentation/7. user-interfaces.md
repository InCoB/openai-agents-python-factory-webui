# User Interfaces

The framework provides multiple interfaces for interacting with agents and workflows, including a command-line interface and a web-based interface.

## Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run a workflow
aigen execute --workflow content_generation --input "Generate an article about AI" --output article.md

# Interactive mode
aigen interactive

# List available components
aigen list --workflows --agents --tools

# Launch web interface
aigen web --port 8080 --host localhost
```

## Web Interface (Gradio)

```python
from aigen.ui.gradio_app import launch_ui

# Launch the UI
launch_ui(share=True, port=8080)
```

### User Interface Organization

The Gradio web interface is organized into multiple tabs for a better user experience:

1. **Use Predefined Workflow**: Run standard workflows like content generation or research
   ```python
   # In the Gradio UI code
   with gr.TabItem("Use Predefined Workflow"):
       # Input section
       predefined_input_text = gr.Textbox(...)
       
       # Workflow selection dropdown - only shows concrete workflows
       workflow_name = gr.Dropdown(
           choices=self._get_workflow_choices(),
           value="content_generation",
           label="Workflow Type"
       )
       
       # Shows which agents are in the selected workflow
       workflow_agents_info = gr.Markdown(...)
   ```

2. **Create Custom Workflow**: Build workflows by selecting agent combinations
   ```python
   # In the Gradio UI code
   with gr.TabItem("Create Custom Workflow"):
       # Custom workflow builder
       custom_input_text = gr.Textbox(...)
       
       # Multi-select dropdown for agents
       custom_agents = gr.Dropdown(
           choices=self._get_agent_choices(),
           multiselect=True,
           value=["research", "writer"]
       )
   ```

3. **Workflow Management**: View available workflows and agents
   ```python
   # In the Gradio UI code
   with gr.TabItem("Workflow Management"):
       # Lists all available workflows with descriptions
       workflows_table = gr.DataFrame(...)
       
       # Lists all available agents with descriptions
       agents_table = gr.DataFrame(...)
   ```

The interface automatically filters out implementation details like base workflow types ("handoff" and "deterministic"), showing only concrete workflow instances to users.

### Dynamic Workflow Information

The interface dynamically shows which agents are part of each workflow:

```python
# Update workflow agent info when workflow changes
workflow_name.change(
    fn=lambda wf: f"Workflow contains: {', '.join(self._get_workflow_agents(wf))}",
    inputs=[workflow_name],
    outputs=[workflow_agents_info]
)
```

This helps users understand what each workflow does before executing it.

### Custom Workflow Builder

The custom workflow tab allows users to build their own workflows by selecting agents to execute in sequence:

```python
# Execute custom workflow
execute_custom_btn.click(
    fn=self.run_workflow,
    inputs=[gr.State("custom"), custom_agents, custom_input_text, max_turns_custom],
    outputs=[custom_output_text]
)
```

The order of selected agents matters, as they will be executed in sequence with the output of each agent being passed to the next one in the chain.

### UI Component Type Mismatches with Gradio

When working with the Gradio-based UI, you may encounter errors related to component type mismatches. These typically occur when a function returns a data type incompatible with the UI component it's connected to.

#### Common Error: Dictionaries Passed to Markdown Components

A frequent error occurs when a dictionary is passed to a Gradio Markdown component, which expects a string:

```
Error: Cannot convert dict to str implicitly
```

This often happens after refactoring functions to return more structured data (dictionaries) while the UI components remain configured for string outputs.

#### Solution: Use Adapter Functions

Add adapter functions that convert between types:

```python
def dict_to_string_adapter(func):
    """Adapter to convert dictionary outputs to strings for Markdown components."""
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        if isinstance(result, dict):
            # Format dictionary nicely for display
            if "status" in result and "message" in result:
                return result["message"]
            return str(result)
        return result
    return wrapper

# Then use it in your UI setup:
btn.click(
    dict_to_string_adapter(my_func),
    inputs=[...],
    outputs=[result_markdown]
)
```

### Dynamic Workflow Resolution in UI Components

UI components like the Gradio interface don't need to hardcode all available workflows. The system now includes a fallback mechanism to automatically retrieve workflow agent information:

```python
def _get_workflow_agents(self, workflow_name: str) -> List[str]:
    """Get the agent names for a workflow."""
    # Hardcoded workflow agent configurations for common workflows
    workflow_agents = {
        "content_generation": ["research", "strategy", "writer", "editor"],
        "research_only": ["research"],
    }
    
    # Fall back to checking the registry if not found in hardcoded list
    if workflow_name not in workflow_agents and workflow_name in workflow_registry.list():
        try:
            # Try to create a temporary workflow to get its agents
            factory = workflow_registry.get(workflow_name)
            if callable(factory):
                temp_workflow = factory()
                if hasattr(temp_workflow, 'agents'):
                    return [agent.agent_id for agent in temp_workflow.agents]
        except Exception:
            pass
            
    return workflow_agents.get(workflow_name, [])
```

This allows any registered workflow to automatically appear in the UI without manual configuration.

### Integrating Tracing with Gradio

Update your Gradio app's `run_workflow` method:

```python
from agents import trace, gen_trace_id

async def run_workflow(self, 
                      workflow_name: str,
                      custom_agents: List[str],
                      input_text: str,
                      max_turns: int = 80,
                      progress=gr.Progress()) -> str:
    """Run a workflow with the provided parameters."""
    progress(0, "Initializing workflow...")
    
    try:
        # Generate a valid trace ID using the SDK
        trace_id = gen_trace_id()
        
        # Set up the workflow spec based on the selection
        if workflow_name == "custom":
            workflow_spec = custom_agents
        else:
            workflow_spec = workflow_name
        
        # Create a context
        context = Context()
        
        # Create the workflow
        workflow = create_workflow(workflow_spec)
        
        # Create workflow engine
        from ..workflows.engine import WorkflowEngine
        engine = WorkflowEngine()
        
        progress(0.1, "Executing workflow...")
        
        # Wrap execution in a trace context manager
        with trace(f"Workflow: {workflow_name}", trace_id=trace_id):
            # Execute the workflow
            result = await engine.execute(workflow, context, input_text)
            
            progress(0.9, "Completing workflow...")
            
            # Return the result
            if result["status"] == "completed":
                return result["result"]
            else:
                return f"Workflow failed: {result.get('error', 'Unknown error')}\n\n{result.get('result', '')}"
                
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
    finally:
        progress(1.0, "Workflow complete")
```
