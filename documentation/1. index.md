# OpenAI Agents Framework: Full Production Implementation

## 1. Overview

The `aigen` framework provides a complete production implementation of an AI agent workflow system built on top of the OpenAI Agents SDK. This framework enables developers to create, connect, and orchestrate specialized AI agents in flexible workflows with robust error handling and multiple interface options.
